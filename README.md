  # SimosSort

I use this tool to sort through all my datalogs taken from the SimosTools.... Tool?

## Description

This script will sort through a folder, and rename the csv files to the name of your flashed file + the date.

I find this way more easy to sort so you're not potentially looking at incorrect files

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python3
* Windows, Linux, Mac


### Executing program

```python simos_sort.py```
